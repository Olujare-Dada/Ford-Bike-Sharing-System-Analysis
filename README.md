>
> - Weekday and Weekends experience two different patterns for Biking activity.
>
> - There are far more Subscribers than there are Customers.
>
> - The Customers ride bikes for much longer than Subscribers.
>
> - Market St at 10th St. has the highest amount of takeoffs while San Francisco Caltrain Station has the highest arrivals.
>
> - The most common route taken by bikers is Berry St. at 4th St. to San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza)
>
> - San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 is the most busy station.
>
> - The highest bike activity is observed when bikes move from Berry St. at 4th St. to San Francisco Ferry Building (Harry Bridges Plaza)
